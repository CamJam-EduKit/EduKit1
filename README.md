The code contained within this repository is for use with the CamJam Edukit 1, created by the organisers of The Cambridge Raspberry Jam (http://camjam.me), an event for fans of the Raspberry Pi.

There are three versions of the worksheets and code:
* The GPIO Zero version uses the [GPIO Zero library](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/gpio-zero-a-friendly-python-api-for-physical-computing/) on a Raspberry Pi computer.  This is the 
  recommended version for new Python programmers.
* The RPI.GPIO version uses the original GPIO library on a Raspberry Pi computer.
* The Pico version is for learning MicroPython coding on a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. CamJam would like to 
  thank [Simon9933](https://github.com/Simon9933) for his work creating this version of the worksheets.

The kit costs only Â£6 including UK VAT, and is available from [The Pi Hut](http://thepihut.com/collections/camjam-edukit).
